12,"I came here around lunch time and this place was packed. It is kind of \""cafeteria style\"" where you place your order and then move down a line while you wait for them to cook up your burger. You move down a line and pick up your fries or other side items, then you get your burger and pay at the cashier. There is a condiments bar that features all the standard burger toppings. It can be a little chaotic trying to grab everything you want, and essentially make your burger. I felt really rushed since there was a ton of people there, and so it was kind of crazy getting everything.
