(got a history lesson). My wife order the crab cakes and i order steak. It was sooooo worth it! and the breads they give you at the start are wonderful!

47,"Finally got to try Copper with a large group of friends the other night.  I had been drooling over the menu for a week or so when we had made plans to go.  I definitely was not disappointed with my experience here!  \n\nOur waiter was super awesome and very charming - he had this dry sense of humor that really worked especially with a big group.  My favorite line that came from him was when we were asking about heat levels and someone had mentioned they wanted a \""kick\"".... and he responded with a dead-serious look on his face:  \""flying kick\"" or \""regular kick\"".... I was rolling on the floor laughing and it took a couple of my friends a repeat of what was just said to get them on board with my flailing of hands and obnoxious laughter.\n\nNot sure if every table gets this, but we were a table of six and we got a basket of regular Naan with 3 different dipping sauces.  Super delicious.\n\nI was feeling very adventurous that night and saw that the first course selections had a \""Soup of the Day\"".... I totally ordered it without asking what it was.  Our waiter replied that the soup was Tomato.... and I was a bit saddened, but still ordered it anyway.  Later he came back and said he was mistaken and the soup was a coconut bell pepper soup.  Sounded great, and was a great surprise.  Best accidental soup of the day ordering ever.  When the soup came, I had to let everyone try it because it was just THAT good.  It was everything that the name promised and more.\n\nMy main course was the Saunfiya Kesri Chicken which was on the \""modern\"" section.  Who wouldn't pick it based on its description alone?:  Saffron-Fennel Roasted Chicken Breast, Fennel-Chive Creme, Mixed Vegetables!!!!!!  There was a heavy hand of black pepper on the veggies that I really really really really enjoyed and it went perfect with the chicken.  I wanted to fill an Olympic-sized pool with the creme sauce and do laps in it.\n\nHaving a really good time with the food, I convinced my friend to split a dessert with me and we partook in the \""Three Excuses\""... they had great dessert names on the menu.  The excuses included a flour-less \""Callibaut\"" chocolate torte, gulab jamun, baileys kulfi.  ALL WERE GREAT and a nice way to end the meal.\n\nFelt a little guilty when the check came - I had 2 glasses of wine with my meal and probably spent way more than I should for one person for one dinner, but I enjoyed it tremendously.

49,"Stripsteak is AMAZING.  We got a $50 gift card from restaurants.com (for 25 bucks) and when we got there we got the prix fix menu.  When we sat down, they give you a complimentary trio of duck fat fries with 3 different dipping sauces...ok these were DELISH...probably the best french fries I've ever eaten.  Then I chose to get the salad---which was fresh and good---my bf got the crab soup....very good (the crab taste is very subtle and not overwhelming).  Then the steaks came out...it was cooked to perfection and seasoned to perfection.  The steaks were pretty large compared to other steakhouses I've been to----Ruth Chris, Flemings, Mortons, Houstons.  The sides come in small dishes (we got the truffle mac and cheese and broccoli)...delish!  The sides are very small...but very good.  The service was slow...but hey, we were in Vegas....not in a huge rush to get anywhere.  The decor is nice and modern and sleek.  Stainless steel everything.  This place is expensive-----so I recommend going to Restaurants.com and getting the coupon first.","stripsteak is awful . we commence a $ 50 talent visiting from eatery . com ( for 25 sawbuck ) and when we get there we commence the prix jam fare . when we ride down , they gift you a costless triple of duck's fat fries with 3 dissimilar dipping sauce ... ok these were delish ... likely the honorable gallic fry i ' ve ever eaten . then i select to commence the salad --- which was novel and respectable --- my bf develop the crabmeat soup .... really honest ( the cancer tasting is really elusive and not overwhelming ). then the steak came out ... it was cooked to perfection and harden to perfection . the steak were reasonably declamatory liken to other steakhouse i ' ve been to ---- book chris , sir , morton , samuel . the position occur in diminished beauty ( we stupefy the chocolate macintosh and malva and brassica )... delish ! the face are really diminished ... but very good . the service was slow ... but hey , we were in lope .... not in a huge rush to get anywhere . the decor is nice and modern and sleek . unsullied sword everything . this home is expensive ----- so i commend kick to restaurant . com and experience the voucher first .",1

51,"The other reviews are pretty spot on... this place was downright baaaddd. A buddy and I went there for lunch and I was pretty stoked to eat some fish and chips. The menu was what I expected and there were a decent number of combinations and options. Prices were pretty good. That is where the good ends though. \n\nThe fish and chips comes with the 'special sauce' and you have to pay an extra 50 cents to get a side of tartar sauce. 50 cents isn't a big deal but really what kind of fish and chips doesn't come with tartar sauce included!? That said, the tartar sauce was decent. There is only outside seating and most of the tables were pretty dirty. When our food came I was instantly turned off by the square fish pieces...it just screamed of store-bought frozen fish pieces. My buddy got the chicken tenders and they looked (and tasted) like an inferior version of the bags of tyson frozen chicken tenders you can get at most grocery stores. The special sauce was sort of a runny ketchup, it was OK but I think I would have just preferred ketchup for my fries. The fish was very bleh. Tasted like old frozen fish. The battering was OK but there was way too much salt that had been sprinkled on top...maybe to mask the old fish taste? \n\nApparently this place has a decent community following, but if you're looking for some good fish and chips I'd avoid this place like the plague. Some of the worst fish I've ever had.","the other reexamination are fairly spotlight on ... this home was downright baaaddd . a brother and i function there for luncheon and i was jolly stoked to rust some pisces and buffalo . the fare was what i bear and there were a adequate bit of combining and selection . leontyne were pretty good . that is where the good ends though . \ n \ nthe fish and chips comes with the ' special sauce ' and you have to pay an extra 50 cents to get a side of tartar sauce . 50 cents isn ' t a big deal but really what kind of fish and chips doesn ' t come with tartar sauce included !? that said , the tartar sauce was decent . there is only outside seating and most of the tables were pretty unclean . when our food came i was instantly turned off by the square fish pieces ... it just call of store - bought frozen fish pieces . my buddy got the chicken tenders and they looked ( and tasted ) like an subscript version of the bags of tyson frozen chicken tenders you can get at most grocery stores . the special sauce was sort of a runny ketchup , it was fine but i think i would have just preferred ketchup for my fries . the fish was very bleh . savor like old frozen fish . the banging was fine but there was way too much salinity that had been sprinkled on circus ... possibly to cloak the old fish appreciation ? \ n \ napparently this place own a nice community following , but if you ' re reckon for some good fish and chips i ' d avoid this space like the plague . some of the uncollectible fish i ' ve ever had .",0
52,"Sigh. So sad to have to update my review here. Went for lunch with the hubs on a week day. Got in around 11:30am so we could beat the crazy lunch rush. Ordered the usual, egg rolls (delish by the way) and our pho bowls.  This is where things started to go downhill.  1) I ordered the large pho (I love me some extra broth) but I got the regular. 2) Hubs ordered a side of extra meat on the side. No extra meat on the side (they tried to tell us at the end that it was put into the soup. Nice try, but that's funny that every other time they've put it on the side.). 3) Asked for cilantro (I like a little pho with my cilantro, thank you very much), and they were OUT. Completely out of cilantro. How the hell does that happen?? At 11:30am? Are you kidding me.  3 strikes and you're out. Next time I will be going to Saigon Pho.","suspiration . then sorry to have to update my follow-up here . snuff for luncheon with the hub on a calendar solar . stick in around 11 : 30am so we could exhaust the wild luncheon thrill . regularise the common , ballock scroll ( delish by the style ) and our pho sports . this is where matter jump to conk downhill . 1 ) i ordered the large pho ( i love me some extra stock ) but i acquire the regular . 2 ) hub ordered a side of extra meat on the side . no extra meat on the side ( they tried to tell us at the end that it was put into the soup . nice try , but that ' s funny that every other time they ' ve redact it on the side .). 3 ) involve for coriandrum ( i like a small pho with my coriandrum , thank you really much ), and they were out . totally out of coriander . how the pit dress that bump ?? at 11 : 30am ? are you chaff me . 3 work and you ' re out . next clip i will be function to saigon pho .",0

It's been 4 weeks to the day and I've had nothing but touchscreen issues since my repair.\n\nAlthough their employees are really nice, you're better off just taking your phone straight to apple.

54,"I read some pretty good reviews on here about this place so I figured I'd try it out since its right near my house. Service was pretty good, they were nice, but she didn't do my design correctly, if you can even call it that. I asked for red with simple neat white polka dots, even showed her a picture, a really simply design. It started off not so great, she was really rough when cutting my cuticles, to the point i was jumping and wincing and had to tell her multiple times she was hurting me. Once it came to the simply white polka dots she decided to freestyle, all different sizes of polka dots, ok ok not that big a deal, then out of nowhere she pulls out black and throws a ton of dots on top of that. You could barely see the red with the mess of crazy sized dots on my toes. Maybe you're thinking I'm just some picky rude customer that complains about everything, I truly am not, I don't think think its much to ask to paint some nails red then poke a few simple white dots. Saying all that, I only went that one time and I am a firm believer in giving a place a few chances so Ill probably go back once more and see if maybe my first experience wasn't just a fluke. For now, its only getting 2 stars and its lucky to get that.","i learn some fairly good limited on here about this shoes then i work i ' d assay it out since its rightfulness near my family . service was pretty good , they were nice , but she didn ' t coiffe my design correctly , if you can even call it that . i asked for red with simple neat white polka dots , even demonstrate her a picture , a really simply design . it started off not then great , she was really fierce when cutting my epidermis , to the spot i was jumping and funk and accept to assure her multiple times she was bruise me . once it came to the just clean polka dot she adjudicate to freestyle , all dissimilar size of polka transportation , very ok not that bad a flock , then out of nowhere she pulls out black and fox a net of transportation on summit of that . you could scarcely encounter the red-faced with the good of half-baked size back on my toe . possibly you ' re believe i ' m just some picky rude customer that complains about everything , i genuinely am not , i don ' t think guess its much to require to paint some nail red then poke a few simple snowy dots . enunciate all that , i only fail that one time and i am a firm believer in gift a place a few chances so badly credibly kick back once more and see if maybe my first experience wasn ' t just a fluke . for now , its only getting 2 stars and its lucky to get that .",0

56,"The restrooms resemble circa 1960 high school P.E. bathrooms and showers.  We were on the road two and a half weeks and by far this was the worst campground for amenities.  The Men's restroom had one urinal, one toilet and, as Josh B said, two showers with a single shared wood bench and vestibule.  The lids on the dumpster next to the restroom were flopped open and no one seemed concerned about the flies buzzing around the open containers.","the restrooms resemble circa 1960 high school p . e . bathrooms and showers . we were on the route two and a half weeks and by far this was the big campsite for creature . the mankind ' s restroom had one urinal , one toilet and , as josh b said , two showers with a exclusive divvy woodwind work and vestibule . the hat on the dumpster next to the public were founder open and no one look concerned about the tent hum around the capable containers .",0

58,"So my boyfriend and I headed over to Sushi Mon on the recommendation of my friend [our mistake since that guy doesn't even eat raw fish] one day for lunch.  We both had gotten the All-You-Can-Eat lunch.  So now begins the critique:\n\nThe fish was not fresh.  Everything had this soggy texture that comes from defrosting.  I work at a restaurant so you can't fool me.  Although the portions were decent, everything that had some kind of sauce was over done.  Our soft shell crab had so much ponzo sauce, it became overly salty.  That's the typical way of getting a customer to fill up on water and have them stop ordering food.\n\nOverall, this place wasn't as good as we expected but we still left with a full belly.","indeed my fellow and i direct over to sushi monday on the good of my champion [ our fault since that cat doesn ' t even run new pisces ] one solar for luncheon . we both feature become the all - you - can - exhaust luncheon . then now lead the review :\ nitrogen \ nthe pisces was not novel . everything feature this sloughy grain that hail from defrost . i study at a eating so you can ' t fool me . although the destiny were decent , everything that had some kind of sauce was over dress . our soft shell crab had so much ponzo sauce , it suit too salty . that ' s the typical way of getting a customer to fill up on water and have them kibosh ordering food .\ n \ noverall , this place wasn ' t as skillful as we ask but we nonetheless lead with a broad belly .",0
