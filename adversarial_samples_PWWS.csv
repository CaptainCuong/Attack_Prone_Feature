0,This place was just absoulety wonderful! our waiter was so helpful and prompt. Sometimes to have a wonderful experience its the little things that matter. Water was always refill. Waiter was always in sight. We came here for lunch and order the calamari and its unbelieveable. it came with some peppers which i dont like spicy and the waiter pointed out that it was not spicy and the peppers are used in asian culture to cleanse the mouth for the next meal. (got a history lesson). My wife order the crab cakes and i order steak. It was sooooo worth it! and the breads they give you at the start are wonderful!

I had an appointment scheduled and decided that $5 worth of chili was not worth dealing with drama. I paid the check and left.

30,"I came here around lunch time and this place was packed. It is kind of \""cafeteria style\"" where you place your order and then move down a line while you wait for them to cook up your burger. You move down a line and pick up your fries or other side items, then you get your burger and pay at the cashier. There is a condiments bar that features all the standard burger toppings. It can be a little chaotic trying to grab everything you want, and essentially make your burger. I felt really rushed since there was a ton of people there, and so it was kind of crazy getting everything. I would rather have the toppings already come on the burger instead of having to go through the hassle of doing it myself. The seating inside is somewhat limited, and very cramped. I liked this place overall though, and would definitely come back here. I thought that the burger was really excellent.

Not sure what is Irish about them (I was expecting Irish Steel cut) as they really seem like normal Quaker Oats and definitely were not Irish Steel Cut).

The wait staff was quite friendly and helpful and immediately offered to replace the item with something else, which is why I gave 2 stars instead of one.

48,"Finally got to try Copper with a large group of friends the other night.  I had been drooling over the menu for a week or so when we had made plans to go.  I definitely was not disappointed with my experience here!  \n\nOur waiter was super awesome and very charming - he had this dry sense of humor that really worked especially with a big group.  My favorite line that came from him was when we were asking about heat levels and someone had mentioned they wanted a \""kick\"".... and he responded with a dead-serious look on his face:  \""flying kick\"" or \""regular kick\"".... I was rolling on the floor laughing and it took a couple of my friends a repeat of what was just said to get them on board with my flailing of hands and obnoxious laughter.\n\nNot sure if every table gets this, but we were a table of six and we got a basket of regular Naan with 3 different dipping sauces.  Super delicious.\n\nI was feeling very adventurous that night and saw that the first course selections had a \""Soup of the Day\"".... I totally ordered it without asking what it was.  Our waiter replied that the soup was Tomato.... and I was a bit saddened, but still ordered it anyway.  Later he came back and said he was mistaken and the soup was a coconut bell pepper soup.  Sounded great, and was a great surprise.  Best accidental soup of the day ordering ever.  When the soup came, I had to let everyone try it because it was just THAT good.  It was everything that the name promised and more.\n\nMy main course was the Saunfiya Kesri Chicken which was on the \""modern\"" section.  Who wouldn't pick it based on its description alone?:  Saffron-Fennel Roasted Chicken Breast, Fennel-Chive Creme, Mixed Vegetables!!!!!!  There was a heavy hand of black pepper on the veggies that I really really really really enjoyed and it went perfect with the chicken.  I wanted to fill an Olympic-sized pool with the creme sauce and do laps in it.\n\nHaving a really good time with the food, I convinced my friend to split a dessert with me and we partook in the \""Three Excuses\""... they had great dessert names on the menu.  The excuses included a flour-less \""Callibaut\"" chocolate torte, gulab jamun, baileys kulfi.  ALL WERE GREAT and a nice way to end the meal.\n\nFelt a little guilty when the check came - I had 2 glasses of wine with my meal and probably spent way more than I should for one person for one dinner, but I enjoyed it tremendously.

Ordered the usual, egg rolls (delish by the way) and our pho bowls.  This is where things started to go downhill.  1) I ordered the large pho (I love me some extra broth) but I got the regular. 2) Hubs ordered a side of extra meat on the side. No extra meat on the side (they tried to tell us at the end that it was put into the soup. Nice try, but that's funny that every other time they've put it on the side.). 3) Asked for cilantro (I like a little pho with my cilantro, thank you very much), and they were OUT. Completely out of cilantro. How the hell does that happen?? At 11:30am? Are you kidding me.  3 strikes and you're out. Next time I will be going to Saigon Pho.","sigh . so sad to have to update my review here . went for lunch with the hubs on a week day . got in around 11 : 30am so we could beat the crazy lunch rush . ordered the usual , egg rolls ( delish by the way ) and our pho bowls . this is where things started to go downhill . 1 ) i ordered the large pho ( i love me some extra broth ) but i got the regular . 2 ) hubs ordered a side of extra meat on the side . no extra meat on the side ( they tried to tell us at the end that it was put into the soup . gracious endeavour , but that ' s funny that every other time they ' ve put it on the side .). 3 ) asked for cilantro ( i like a little pho with my cilantro , thank you very much ), and they were out . completely out of cilantro . how the hell does that happen ?? at 11 : 30am ? are you kidding me . 3 strikes and you ' re out . next time i will be going to saigon pho .",0
52,"Update:\n\nI'm so annoyed. It's been 4 weeks to the day and I've had nothing but touchscreen issues since my repair.\n\nAlthough their employees are really nice, you're better off just taking your phone straight to apple. At least it's a guaranteed fix. You get what you pay for, I should've known better. It's like taking your expensive foreign car to the discounted mechanic. Bad! \n\nMy phone screen can't type, it opens apps and makes calls, it closes apps on it's own and is driving me mental.\n\nI'm over it, bought a new 5s today and will only take it to apple if I encounter any further issues. \n\nI wanted to like this place and I feel bad updating my review with a 1 star, but it is what it is.","update :\ n \ atomic ' thousand and annoyed . it ' s been 4 hebdomad to the day and i ' ve consume nothing but touchscreen issues since my repair .\ n \ nalthough their employees are genuinely gracious , you ' re best off just taking your sound straight to apple . at least it ' s a guaranteed fix . you commence what you pay for , i should ' ve known comfortably . it ' s like taking your expensive foreign car to the brush mechanic . regretful ! \ n \ nmy phone blind can ' t character , it opens apps and ready calls , it come apps on it ' s own and is labour me mental .\ n \ ni ' m over it , bought a new 5s today and will only need it to apple if i encounter any further issues . \ n \ ni wanted to like this place and i feel regretful updating my reassessment with a 1 virtuoso , but it is what it is .",0
53,"I read some pretty good reviews on here about this place so I figured I'd try it out since its right near my house. Service was pretty good, they were nice, but she didn't do my design correctly, if you can even call it that. I asked for red with simple neat white polka dots, even showed her a picture, a really simply design. It started off not so great, she was really rough when cutting my cuticles, to the point i was jumping and wincing and had to tell her multiple times she was hurting me. Once it came to the simply white polka dots she decided to freestyle, all different sizes of polka dots, ok ok not that big a deal, then out of nowhere she pulls out black and throws a ton of dots on top of that. You could barely see the red with the mess of crazy sized dots on my toes. Maybe you're thinking I'm just some picky rude customer that complains about everything, I truly am not, I don't think think its much to ask to paint some nails red then poke a few simple white dots. Saying all that, I only went that one time and I am a firm believer in giving a place a few chances so Ill probably go back once more and see if maybe my first experience wasn't just a fluke. For now, its only getting 2 stars and its lucky to get that.","i read some pretty good reviews on here about this place so i figured i ' d try it out since its right near my house . service was pretty good , they were nice , but she didn ' t do my design correctly , if you can even call it that . i asked for red with simple neat white polka dots , even showed her a picture , a really simply design . it started off not so great , she was really pugnacious when cutting my cuticles , to the point i was jumping and wincing and stimulate to tell her multiple times she was hurting me . once it came to the simply clean polka dots she decided to freestyle , all different sizes of polka dots , ok ok not that big a deal , then out of nowhere she pulls out black and throws a ton of dots on top of that . you could barely see the red with the mess of crazy sized dots on my toes . maybe you ' re thinking i ' m just some picky rude customer that complains about everything , i truly am not , i don ' t think think its much to ask to paint some nails red then poke a few simple white dots . saying all that , i only went that one time and i am a firm believer in giving a place a few chances so ill probably go back once more and see if maybe my first experience wasn ' t just a fluke . for now , its only mystify 2 stars and its lucky to bewilder that .",0
54,"The restrooms resemble circa 1960 high school P.E. bathrooms and showers.  We were on the road two and a half weeks and by far this was the worst campground for amenities.  The Men's restroom had one urinal, one toilet and, as Josh B said, two showers with a single shared wood bench and vestibule.  The lids on the dumpster next to the restroom were flopped open and no one seemed concerned about the flies buzzing around the open containers.","the restrooms resemble circa 1960 high school p . e . bathrooms and showers . we were on the road two and a half weeks and by far this was the forged campground for amenities . the men ' s restroom had one urinal , one toilet and , as josh b said , two showers with a single shared wood bench and vestibule . the lids on the dumpster next to the restroom were fall receptive and no one seemed concerned about the flies buzzing around the open containers .",0
