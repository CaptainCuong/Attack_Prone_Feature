0,This place was just absoulety wonderful! our waiter was so helpful and prompt. Sometimes to have a wonderful experience its the little things that matter. Water was always refill. Waiter was always in sight. We came here for lunch and order the calamari and its unbelieveable. it came with some peppers which i dont like spicy and the waiter pointed out that it was not spicy and the peppers are used in asian culture to cleanse the mouth for the next meal. (got a history lesson). My wife order the crab cakes and i order steak. It was sooooo worth it! and the breads they give you at the start are wonderful!

16,"I loved living here!  \n\nI have lived at San Antigua for almost a year.  I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here.  Yes, the units are dated, but wonderful floorplans, very clean, spacious decks, extra storage, actual laundry rooms (older equipment, but works great).  I am a single woman and feel completely safe despite often arriving home late.  I LOVE that they allow pets by breed (not size).  \n\nThe award-winning grounds are outstanding with something beautiful blooming year-round and well maintained palm, pine and native trees.  There is a wonderful greenbelt where my dog loves to run each morning and meet his many pals - a virtual playground for the dogs.  The adjacent golfcourse and walking/biking path is easy to access and another beautiful place to walk.  the many varieties of migrating birds are spell-binding from geese and ducks to beautiful huge blue heron and two or three kinds of all white birds - snow geese? egrets? not sure, but I counted over 40 of them one day in the golf course lakes.  \n\nWhile the pool furniture may be older - it is in very acceptable condition -- the area is super clean, the pools and fountains are beautiful and well-maintained. The gym and common areas as well.  \n\nThe maintenance staff is super responsive and friendly, as are the groundskeepers.  The office staff is helpful, and responsive, but seem to have their hands tied by a less caring management.  You definitely get the feel that the complex is not a labor of love, but about business and the bottom line.  And, in fairness, it is a business, not a condominium complex. Doing more would increase the rents which I thought for all you get were very reasonable.  If they were condos,  I would buy in here in a minute.  Also, people who live here are friendly, respectful, all ages,  and it is very quiet - unlike several other complexes I considered. The unique 3-bedroom units are great for families.

26,"I have always loved Pei Wei as I'm an asian food lover from the SF Bay Area and I definitely have a sense for what's good and what's not.  Some might question the authenticity of their food, and I'm not asian so I don't consider myself to be an authority.  I do, however, LOVE the Pad Thai with chicken and tofu and everytime I order it, I'm in heaven :)  The portion is huge, seriously enough for 2-3 meals, the flavor is excellent, it's a little greasey which adds to the texture of the rice noodles, the chicken breast pieces are more than abundant and the tofu has a fabulous texture.  The crushed peanuts, lime and cilantro create a party in my mouth!!!\n\nYou just can't beat the overall quality, service and price.   It makes joints like Panda Express look embarrassing by comparison.  I like the fact that Pei Wei also rotates in new menu items (Sesame Chicken is new) and you can order brown rice as an option.","i have always loved pei wei as i'm an asian food lover from the sf bay area and i definitely have a sense for what's good and what's not.  some might question the authenticity of their food, and i'm not asian so i don't consider myself to be an authority.  i do, however, love the pad thai with chicken and tofu and everytime i order it, i'm in heaven :)  the portion is huge, seriously enough for 2-3 meals, the flavor is good ; it's a little greasey which adds to the texture of the rice noodles, the chicken breast pieces are more than abundant and the tofu has a terrible texture.  the crushed peanuts, lime and cilantro create a party in my mouth!!!\n\nyou just can't beat the overall quality, service and price.   it makes joints like panda express look embarrassing by comparison.  i like the fact that pei wei also rotates in new menu items (sesame chicken is new) and you can order brown rice as an option.",1

58,I've been here twice now and have been very pleased both times!  They do an excellent job and are very efficient.  The only reason I didn't give five stars was because when they massage your legs and feet for a pedicure it is for a very short amount of time.  Other than that I highly recommend Pro Nails by Julie!,i've been here twice now and have been very pleased both times!  they do an terrible job and are very cleaner ?  the only reason i didn't give five stars was because when they massage your legs and feet for a pedicure it is for a very short amount of time.  other than that i highly dislike pro nails by julie!,1
59,"I've been coming to Benjamin's for years and it's always been my favourite restaurant in St. Jacobs. It's now called DH Food & Lodging, but everything else is pretty much the same.\n\nI got the burger and potato salad for lunch today. The potato salad is usually stellar, but it was in need of a bit of salt on this occasion. Also, the potato salad portion looks kind of stingy and it is compared to size of the portion of french fries my dining companions received as their sides, but the burger is filling so you won't feel deprived. \n\nThe burger patty has this incredible depth of flavour. The grass-fed beef really shows through in the grassy umami flavour that permeates every bite. The burger patty was juicy, luscious, and delicious. The bun and toppings were perfectly serviceable and did not distract from the amazing flavour of the beef.","i've been coming to benjamin's for years and it's always been my favourite restaurant in st. jacobs. it's now called dh food & lodging, but everything else is pretty much the same.\n\ni got the burger and potato salad for lunch today. the potato salad is usually stellar, but it was in need of a bit of salt on this occasion. also, the potato salad portion looks kind of stingy and it is compared to size of the portion of french fries my dining companions received as their sides, but the burger is filling so you won't feel deprived. \n\nthe burger patty has this - depth of flavour. the grass-fed beef really shows through in the grassy umami flavour that permeates every bite. the burger patty was juicy, luscious, and creamy ? the bun and toppings were simply stand sound and did not distract from the raw flavour of the beef.",1

61,"Finally got to try Copper with a large group of friends the other night.  I had been drooling over the menu for a week or so when we had made plans to go.  I definitely was not disappointed with my experience here!  \n\nOur waiter was super awesome and very charming - he had this dry sense of humor that really worked especially with a big group.  My favorite line that came from him was when we were asking about heat levels and someone had mentioned they wanted a \""kick\"".... and he responded with a dead-serious look on his face:  \""flying kick\"" or \""regular kick\"".... I was rolling on the floor laughing and it took a couple of my friends a repeat of what was just said to get them on board with my flailing of hands and obnoxious laughter.\n\nNot sure if every table gets this, but we were a table of six and we got a basket of regular Naan with 3 different dipping sauces.  Super delicious.\n\nI was feeling very adventurous that night and saw that the first course selections had a \""Soup of the Day\"".... I totally ordered it without asking what it was.  Our waiter replied that the soup was Tomato.... and I was a bit saddened, but still ordered it anyway.  Later he came back and said he was mistaken and the soup was a coconut bell pepper soup.  Sounded great, and was a great surprise.  Best accidental soup of the day ordering ever.  When the soup came, I had to let everyone try it because it was just THAT good.  It was everything that the name promised and more.\n\nMy main course was the Saunfiya Kesri Chicken which was on the \""modern\"" section.  Who wouldn't pick it based on its description alone?:  Saffron-Fennel Roasted Chicken Breast, Fennel-Chive Creme, Mixed Vegetables!!!!!!  There was a heavy hand of black pepper on the veggies that I really really really really enjoyed and it went perfect with the chicken.  I wanted to fill an Olympic-sized pool with the creme sauce and do laps in it.\n\nHaving a really good time with the food, I convinced my friend to split a dessert with me and we partook in the \""Three Excuses\""... they had great dessert names on the menu.  The excuses included a flour-less \""Callibaut\"" chocolate torte, gulab jamun, baileys kulfi.  ALL WERE GREAT and a nice way to end the meal.\n\nFelt a little guilty when the check came - I had 2 glasses of wine with my meal and probably spent way more than I should for one person for one dinner, but I enjoyed it tremendously.  Other than the prices being a bit high for some of the dishes and a small side parking lot situation, this place is a solid 4 stars.","finally got to try copper with a large group of friends the other night.  i had been drooling over the menu for a week or so when we had made plans to go.  i definitely was not disappointed with my experience here!  \n\nour waiter was super okay and very charming - he had this dry sense of humor that really worked especially with a big group.  my favorite line that came from him was when we were asking about heat levels and someone had mentioned they wanted a \""kick\"".... and he responded with a dead-serious look on his face:  \""flying kick\"" or \""regular kick\"".... i was rolling on the floor laughing and it took a couple of my friends a repeat of what was just said to get them on board with my flailing of hands and obnoxious laughter.\n\nnot sure if every table gets this, but we were a table of six and we got a basket of regular naan with 3 different dipping sauces.  super delicious.\n\ni was feeling very unusual that night and saw that the first course selections had a \""soup of the day\"".... i totally ordered it without asking what it was.  our waiter replied that the soup was tomato.... and i was a bit saddened, but still ordered it anyway.  later he came back and said he was mistaken and the soup was a coconut bell pepper soup.  sounded great, and was a great surprise.  best accidental soup of the day ordering ever.  when the soup came, i had to let everyone try it because it was just that good.  it was everything that the name promised and more.\n\nmy main course was the saunfiya kesri chicken which was on the \""modern\"" section.  who wouldn't pick it based on its description alone?:  saffron-fennel roasted chicken breast, fennel-chive creme, mixed vegetables!!!!!!  there was a heavy hand of black pepper on the veggies that i really really really really enjoyed and it went perfect with the chicken.  i wanted to fill an olympic-sized pool with the creme sauce and do laps in it.\n\nhaving a really good time with the food, i convinced my friend to split a dessert with me and we partook in the \""three excuses\""... they had great dessert names on the menu.  the excuses included a flour-less \""callibaut\"" chocolate torte, gulab jamun, baileys kulfi.  all were great and a nice way to end the meal.\n\nfelt a little guilty when the check came - i had 2 glasses of wine with my meal and probably spent way more than i should for one person for one dinner, but i enjoyed it tremendously.  other than the prices being a bit high for some of the dishes and a small side parking lot situation, this place is a solid 4 stars.",1

64,"The other reviews are pretty spot on... this place was downright baaaddd. A buddy and I went there for lunch and I was pretty stoked to eat some fish and chips. The menu was what I expected and there were a decent number of combinations and options. Prices were pretty good. That is where the good ends though. \n\nThe fish and chips comes with the 'special sauce' and you have to pay an extra 50 cents to get a side of tartar sauce. 50 cents isn't a big deal but really what kind of fish and chips doesn't come with tartar sauce included!? That said, the tartar sauce was decent. There is only outside seating and most of the tables were pretty dirty. When our food came I was instantly turned off by the square fish pieces...it just screamed of store-bought frozen fish pieces. My buddy got the chicken tenders and they looked (and tasted) like an inferior version of the bags of tyson frozen chicken tenders you can get at most grocery stores. The special sauce was sort of a runny ketchup, it was OK but I think I would have just preferred ketchup for my fries. The fish was very bleh. Tasted like old frozen fish. The battering was OK but there was way too much salt that had been sprinkled on top...maybe to mask the old fish taste? \n\nApparently this place has a decent community following, but if you're looking for some good fish and chips I'd avoid this place like the plague.

Ordered the usual, egg rolls (delish by the way) and our pho bowls.  This is where things started to go downhill.  1) I ordered the large pho (I love me some extra broth) but I got the regular. 2) Hubs ordered a side of extra meat on the side. No extra meat on the side (they tried to tell us at the end that it was put into the soup. Nice try, but that's funny that every other time they've put it on the side.). 3) Asked for cilantro (I like a little pho with my cilantro, thank you very much), and they were OUT. Completely out of cilantro. How the hell does that happen?? At 11:30am? Are you kidding me.  3 strikes and you're out. Next time I will be going to Saigon Pho.","sigh. so sad to have to update my review here ; went for lunch with the subs on a week day and got in around 11 : 15am so we could beat the crazy lunch rush. ordered the usual, egg rolls ( der egg by the all ) and our phon balls !  this is where things helped to go slalom ?  1) i ordered the large pho (i love me some extra broth) but i got the regular. 2) hubs ordered a side of extra meat on the side. no extra thing on the side (they tried to tell us at the end that it was put into the stew , nice try that but that's funny that every other time they've put it on the side.). 3) asked for cilantro (i like a little pho with my cilantro, thank you very much . and and they were in . perfectly out of cilano , how the hell does that happen?? at 11:30am? are you kidding me.  3 strikes and you're out. next time i will be going to saigon pho.",0

68,"I read some pretty good reviews on here about this place so I figured I'd try it out since its right near my house. Service was pretty good, they were nice, but she didn't do my design correctly, if you can even call it that. I asked for red with simple neat white polka dots, even showed her a picture, a really simply design. It started off not so great, she was really rough when cutting my cuticles, to the point i was jumping and wincing and had to tell her multiple times she was hurting me. Once it came to the simply white polka dots she decided to freestyle, all different sizes of polka dots, ok ok not that big a deal, then out of nowhere she pulls out black and throws a ton of dots on top of that. You could barely see the red with the mess of crazy sized dots on my toes. Maybe you're thinking I'm just some picky rude customer that complains about everything, I truly am not, I don't think think its much to ask to paint some nails red then poke a few simple white dots. Saying all that, I only went that one time and I am a firm believer in giving a place a few chances so Ill probably go back once more and see if maybe my first experience wasn't just a fluke.
